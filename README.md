This is the inventory management app using python and UI as tkinter.

1. Open dashborad.py in your text editor and run .
2. You can register with random email and login.
3. There are two roles , admin and employee , as usual you can manage your employee and category as an admin and for employee ,they can only access to sales.

I'm developing web version of this in the future.
